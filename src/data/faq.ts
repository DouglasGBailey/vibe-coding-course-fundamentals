    question: "Do I need any coding experience to take this course?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely not! This course is specifically designed for complete beginners. We start from zero and use AI tools to help you build from your very first lesson. If you can write an email, you can learn vibe coding.",

  {
    question: "What is Gemini CLI and do I need to pay for it?",
    answer:
      "Gemini CLI is Google's command-line AI coding tool. It has a generous free tier that's more than enough for this entire course. We'll walk you through the installation step by step in Module 1.",
    category: "Getting Started",
  },
  {
    question: "What computer do I need?",
    answer:
      "Any modern computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux) with at least 4GB of RAM and an internet connection will work. You don't need a powerful machine — the AI does the heavy lifting in the cloud.",
    category: "Getting Started",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the course take to complete?",
    answer:
      "The course contains about 17 hours of content across 6 modules. Most students complete it in 4-6 weeks studying part-time (a few hours per week). You can go at your own pace with lifetime access.",

  },
  {
    question: "What will I be able to build after the course?",
    answer:
      "By the end, you'll be able to build responsive websites, web applications with React, connect to databases, handle user authentication, and deploy live to the internet. Students have built portfolios, business landing pages, internal tools, and SaaS prototypes.",
    category: "Course",
  },
  {
    question: "Are the quizzes graded?",
    answer:
      "The quizzes are for self-assessment — they help you check your understanding after each module. You get immediate feedback with explanations for each answer. There's no pass/fail, and you can retake them as many times as you like.",
    category: "Course",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this just copy-pasting AI-generated code?",
    answer:
      "Not at all. While you'll use AI to generate code, a core part of the course is understanding what the AI produces. You'll learn to read, debug, customize, and improve the code. The goal is to be a confident builder, not just a prompter.",
    category: "Course",
  },
  {
    question: "How do the tutoring sessions work?",
    answer:
      "Sessions are conducted via video call (Zoom or Google Meet). You share your screen, and we work through your code together in real-time. Before each session, you share your goals and current project so the tutor can prepare a focused plan.",
    category: "Tutoring",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I book tutoring without buying the course?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Tutoring sessions can be booked independently. However, we recommend taking the course first (or alongside tutoring) as it provides the structured foundation that makes tutoring sessions much more productive.",
    category: "Tutoring",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need to reschedule a session?",
    answer:
      "You can reschedule up to 24 hours before your session at no charge through the Calendly booking link. Late cancellations and no-shows are counted as used sessions.",
    category: "Tutoring",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a refund policy?",
    answer:
      "Yes. If you're not satisfied with the course within the first 14 days, we'll give you a full refund — no questions asked. For tutoring, unused sessions can be refunded at any time.",
    category: "Pricing",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any recurring fees?",
    answer:
      "No. All our pricing is one-time payment with lifetime access. There are no subscriptions, hidden fees, or upsells. You pay once and get access forever, including all future course updates.",
    category: "Pricing",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer team or group pricing?",
    answer:
      "Yes! If you want to enroll a team of 3 or more, get in touch through the contact form and we'll create a custom package with group discounts and tailored content.",
    category: "Pricing",
  },
  {
    question: "Will AI replace programmers?",
    answer:
      "AI is changing programming, not replacing programmers. The people who learn to work effectively with AI tools will be the most valuable developers in the market. This course teaches you to be one of those people.",
    category: "General",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from free YouTube tutorials?",
    answer:
      "Free tutorials teach coding concepts. This course teaches you a complete workflow for building real projects with AI — structured, progressive, and with quizzes and optional mentorship. It's the difference between watching cooking videos and attending a cooking class.",
